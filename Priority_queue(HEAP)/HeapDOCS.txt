Heap or priority queue -  it stores data in specific order and the order is depend upon its types
1 -> min Heaps --> the smallest element is always at the top
2 -> max heaps  --> the largest element is always at the top

push,pop,top three operations are generally performed by this .


identifaction of question if k+smallest/largest == max heap/min heap (respectively). 


declaration of 

1.max heap   =  priority_queue<int>maxh;  // data structure can be of any type --> ex. float or vector<int> or pair<int,int> etc.

2.min heap   = priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>>minh;


operations are implemented by using dot(.) operator ex -> minh/maxh.push()/.pop()/.top()

after pop or push priority queue again rearrange there elements in order depended upon it type that is if it is 
min heap the smaller eles get at the top and for max heap largest elements can get at the top;

top just give you the toppest value of that heap and it don't effect on existing priority_queue(heap)


generally all question of heap can be solved by using sorting but sorting will take O(nlogn) time although heap 
is going to take just O(nlogK)  that means it is more efficient than sorting because here we are sorting the 
specific number of elements which is necessary to be sort.

questions :--
it is one of the famous topics of interveiwer so be prepared here are some common questions of heap

to solve these questions you will have to atleast an about of working of pair or map or vector functions .


1.k smallest/greatest elements 
2.k closed number to a given number
3.top k frequent numbers 
4.frequency sort
5.k closet point to origin
6.connected ropes 
7.sum of elements b/w k1^th smallest/largest or k2^th smallest/largest number.
and many more questions ..........
