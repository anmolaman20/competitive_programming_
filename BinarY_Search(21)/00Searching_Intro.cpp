//here is intro of Searching --->
/*
   searching means we have to saerch a key element in a given list and print the 
   index value of that element if it is found otherwise it will print element not 
   Found 
*/

/*There are two Types of Searching 1.LinearSearch --> O(n)   and 
2.BinarySearch --> O(logn)
*/

/*in Linear Search we search the key ele in entire list but in Binary Search -->
  Binary Search is Only applicable when All elements in array is sorted given
  so, here we find our element in O(logn) < O(n){linear Search} --> working of BS is
  like first We are finding the mid value then compare Our Element with mid if it 
  equal the return mid other wise check is it greater or less than arr[mid] if
  it is lesser move in left direction by replacing the end = mid-1 and if 
  it is greater than arr[mid]  then replace start = mid +1 and do so until
  start>end;
*/

/* the questions we are going to Solve In this Series are :--
  1.Binary Search (if arr is sorted in ascending)
  2.Binary Search (if arr is sorted in descending)
  3.Order Agnostic BS(not known arr is sorted in asc or desc)
  4.first Occurence of Element
  5.Last Occurence of an element
  6.count of an element in sorted array
  7.count the of Times array is Rotated
  8.Find the Element in Rotated Sorted Array
  9.Searching In Nearly Sorted Array
  10.Floor of an element
  11.celli of an Element
  12.Next Letter
  13.Index of last 1 in sorted Array
